Jessica Tomas - project6 project report

When implementing project 6, I used an array for the page table, physical memory, and TLB. This caused me to run into some issues since C does not support dynamic arrays. In order to make sure each logic address is translated correct, I first stored the logic address in the logic_address_list and the transferred them into the address_value _list which held physical addresses. When a TLB miss occurs, the user has the option to implement FIFO or LRU replacement strategy. My solution is fairly general but not completely general. I tried to make sure I had very little global variables and mostly local variables. This was a little difficult for me to implement since I had to pass everything through parameters. Changing the size of the TLB and any other structure would be very easy in my implementation since they are defined constants. My program access backing store when the entry it is looking for is not found in the TLB and the page table. Overall my code is elegant. It is a day late because I trouble implementing page_fault_handler() since I needed to update both the TLB and the page table. I documented my address.c and address.h since it came from Dr. Qin in his sample source code.
